cds 490 project
Data:
For this project, I'm using a dataset called "Maryland Counties Socioeconomic Characteristics." 
It contains various demographic information about the 24 counties and Maryland. 
The most important variables for this project are: Population, Median Household Income, White Alone, and Black Alone. 
The variables White Alone and Black Alone hold the amount of white and black people in each county respectively. 


Methods:
With the help of R Studio, I imported the data in the form of .csv files. I got the data from online census surveys in a format that can interact with in the R studio program. 
I used functions inside R studio to create multiple graphs to compare the population of Black people against the total population of each county. 


Hypothesis:
My current hypothesis is that race has a relationship with poverty. I expect to find counties with the highest Black population to have the lowest median income on average, and
maybe other variables such as unemployment or homelessness. With this project I hope to demonstrate the results of systemic racism. 

Preliminary Results:
It seems that counties with the lowest population are the most likely to have to have the lowest median income. Montgomery being significantly different than the others,
having a high total population, a low black population, and a very high median income. In addition, counties like Balitmore and Prince George have high total populations 
and high populations of black people, but the median income is much lower than montgomery and cities with similar total populations. I believe the preceeding facts,
prove my hypothesis correct. 

Visualization:
To better demonstrate the data and prove my hypothesis, I created a map of Maryland. This map will show each county in Maryland and demonstrate a variety of statistics,
most likely the population of black people or median income.
